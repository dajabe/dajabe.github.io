        <p>
          Hi i'm David and this is where I write about myself and the things I
          do. I'm an open source enthusiast and consider myself a life-long
          student. With 10 years of experience in the tech support sector I
          transitioned into writing software. My goal here is to be involved in
          the design and creation of the tools that enable people to do their
          best work.
        </p>

          There is nothing quite like the feeling of finding the resolution to a
          problem. The rush you feel when you crack an especially tricky
          problem, the sense of satisfaction that stays with you whenever you
          get to see your solution at work. This is often the fuel that drives
          me through life.
        </p>
        <p>
          I love using my curiosity to help me solve problems. I want to know
          more about the problem till I get enough of the right pieces together
          to present a solution. The final step is communicating the solution in
          a clear way to enable practical implementation.

          When I'm not problem-solving or learning new things. I'm renovating my
          house, experimenting with home automation, 3D printing, getting
          involved in community sports and walking my dogs.

          My final project at Dev Academy. Designed together with Adam, Nicole,
          and Yuri to provide easy and intuitive time tracking and invoicing
          tool for freelancers.
        </p>
        <p>
          Currently I'm working with the team to release a first version to the
          open source world and put this tool in the hands of freelancers
          everywhere who might need it.
